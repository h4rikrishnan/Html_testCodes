                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
                I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (oh)
                I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
                I realize the time that I wasted here
                I feel like you can't feel the way I feel

                Oh, I'll be f- up if you can't be right here
                Oh, ooh-woah (oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
                Oh, ooh-woah (oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
                Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
                Oh, I'll be f- up if you can't be right here

                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
                I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
                I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey

                When I'm away from you, I miss your touch (ooh)
                You're the reason I believe in love
                It's been difficult for me to trust (ooh)
                And I'm afraid that I'ma f- it up
                Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
                'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
                And you know that I know that I can't live without you

                So, baby, stay
                Oh, ooh-woah (oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
                Oh, ooh-woah (oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
                Oh, ooh-woah (oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
                I'll be f- up if you can't be right here
                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
                I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
                
                I do the same thing I told you that I never would
                I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
                I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
                Woah-oh
                I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
